Development Notes:

- Have only implemented what was on the design
- Data is basic and stored in components. Final app will store them in vuex
- Tabs for songs and Moods are disabled
- Most components need work
- Missed order by select for table

Design Notes:
- Missed out some design due to time
  - Menu font colours aren't right
  - Menu font weight isn't right
  - Overview circles need more time before final implementation
  - Menu items overflow menu column on smaller screens
    - Needs an update to menu to get working properly. Remove .w-100 and use something more flexable
  - Menu shouldn't be part of screen scrolling
    - Currently it fits screen size, which it shouldn't do
  - Unclear on top navbar when agreement is dismissed. Needs design consultation
